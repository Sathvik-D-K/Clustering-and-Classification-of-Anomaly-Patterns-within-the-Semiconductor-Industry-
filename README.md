# Clustering-and-Classification-of-Anomaly-Patterns-within-the-Semiconductor-Industry-

Exploratory data analysis is carried out on the image dataset of defective patterns from microchip
fabrication.
Defective patterns are clustered using the unsupervised machine learning K-means clustering
technique.
The obtained clusters are used as a pseudo label for the classification deep neural networks
